A China dataset of soil properties for land surface modeling (version 2)

This dataset maps 23 soil physical, chemical, and fertility properties at six standard depth layers (0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-100, and 100-200 cm) across China with a spatial resolution of 90 meters. The source data includes 8,979 soil profiles from the Second National Soil Survey of China, 1,641 soil profiles from the World Soil Information Service, 76 soil profiles from the First National Soil Survey of China, and 614 soil profiles from regional databases. This dataset includes pH, sand, silt, clay, bulk density, organic carbon content, gravel, alkali-hydrolysable nitrogen, total nitrogen, cation exchange capacity, porosity, total potassium, total phosphorus, available potassium, available phosphorus, and soil color (in both Munsell and RGB formats). The dataset is provided in raster format, available in both Tiff and netCDF formats. The units for each soil property are detailed in the readme documentation. This dataset offers superior data quality compared to the first edition and is suitable for a wide range of geoscience research, including land surface process modeling.
